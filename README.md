# Voice-Based Automatic Billing

## Description

Streamline the billing process and enhance customer experience with voice-powered AI.

This project explores the development of an AI system capable of handling billing transactions through voice commands, offering a more efficient and user-friendly alternative to traditional methods.

## Key Features

Speech recognition: Accurately identifies spoken items, quantities, and payment preferences.
Natural language processing: Understands the intent and context of user commands.
Database integration: Fetches product information, prices, and customer data.
Payment gateway integration: Processes secure transactions.
Voice prompts and confirmations: Guides users through the billing process and confirms key details.
Error handling: Gracefully handles potential errors and misunderstandings.
Privacy and security: Ensures data protection and user consent.
## Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language
Speech recognition libraries: (e.g., SpeechRecognition, Vosk)
Natural language processing libraries: (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
Database connector libraries: (e.g., psycopg2, PyMySQL)
Payment gateway integration libraries: (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
Text-to-speech libraries: (e.g., pyttsx3)
